Most mass shooters obtain their guns legally, some of which shouldn't have been able to, but were due to problems with gun control laws. The Batman shooter and the recent Florida school shooter both had legal access to assault rifles though both were mentally disturbed. That's a problem. The Church shooter back in November and the recent Florida shcool shooter both had a past of violence, but both had legal access to guns. The Pulse Night Club shooter was on a Terrorist watch list and still had legal access to assault rifles. In all of these cases, the fact that they had access to these assult rifles is wrong. Will they find other ways? Good. Let them find other ways. We can make those options harder too.",

This is DIRECT PROOF that guns are killing our children, and needs to be banned.",

Clearly states \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" If we use this as a guide, then we must acknowledge a \"State\" which requires \"security\" and a \"well regulated Militia\" to provide that security. Taking \"militia\" to mean \"citizens\", then the \"State\" can \"regulate\" without removing the right. Example: Current and former members of armed services allowed to maintain an \"arms license\". Same for police. Civilians must pass stringent safety and background checks - no skipping for type of weapon. A \"force multiplier\" caculation which ranks weapons according to their lethality (power, number of repititions, concealability, etc). Ex: A fist = .5. A knife = 5. A 12 guage shotgun = 20. An AR-15 = 200. Anything over a given number is illegal to purchase and own for anyone outside of the \"regulations\". To actually remove the weapons - take a big chunk of the overblown Defense budget and buy back guns with prices high enough to tempt anyone and everyone to get them out of circulation.",

If people can not be trusted to have guns without killing people, then they shouldn't be allowed guns - you can say that gun crime will still be up,   but really, if an 18 year is now trusted with a gun but isn't trusted with alcohol then priorities clearly need to be set up. People should not be fearing for their lives, kids should not be fearing going to school because the government is not cracking down on the gun laws. As many have said, the UK and Australia had major shootings in the past, implemented gun control, and have had very little sense. When will you look at the statistics? The fact that America has one of the highest amount of shootings (especially in schools - children's lives are on the line, and they shouldn't be) and realise by fighting for someone's right to own a gun, you are only furthering the issue.",

As a pro-gun control believer myself I want to stop the deaths caused by sick people that get a hold of guns. Someone please give me a reason why nothing should be done. Recreational use? Lives are more important. Is it to defend your family from intruders? Statistic's show that it is more likely for a child to get a hold of your gun and hurt themselves or somebody else then it is for someone to break into your house. Even if that doesn't deter you from wanting guns then at least be willing to go through a longer process to get your guns. Please, I actually am being open minded about this and trying to see both sides, but everything points towards stricter gun control.",
